                    Hey, this is Davis Baer writing this, the co-founder of striform. I‚Äôm
                    going to write this in the first person because I think it‚Äôs weird
                    when people write their About page in third person.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    We created striform in 2023 with the intention of giving people a
                    Typeform alternative that was fairly priced - but still had a great UI
                    and UX.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    I lead striform along with my co-founder Abhishek Chakravarty.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    I live in the USA (in Pennsylvania), while Abhishek lives in India (in
                    Bangalore).
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    Both Abhishek and I have started successful software companies in the
                    past:

                <p className="mt-2">
                    I co-founded and grew OneUp (a social media scheduling tool) to
                    millions of dollars in revenue.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    Abhishek has built and sold Botflow, a chatbot builder, amongst a
                    handful of other successful products he‚Äôs created.

                    All form data is securely stored with AWS servers in the USA. The
                    official company name is ‚Äústriform‚Äù, and the business is registered in
                    India.

                    Financially, we are 100% bootstrapped and PROFITABLE, with many paying
                    customers that easily cover our expenses. And we also have nearly
                    infinite runway from the success of our past companies.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                    I‚Äôm not saying this to brag, but rather to give you the confidence
                    that striform WILL be around for years and years to come.
